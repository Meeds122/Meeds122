Hi, I'm @Meeds122, or by human name, Tristan. 

I write software and have a burning interest in security. 

My primary languages are Python for when I need to do work and C when I want to have fun with the machine. I also do minor web development work in the HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL stack. I belive that once you learn how the computer thinks, you can pick up most programming languages with ease. As such, I'm language agnostic. 

You can catch me on Reddit, HackTheBox, HackerRank, and many other websites. 

Welcome!
